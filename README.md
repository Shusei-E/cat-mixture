### Finite Mixture Models with Categorical Data

See [**cat-mixture.pdf**](cat-mixture.pdf) for the writeup of the model.  Source is [cat-mixture.tex](cat-mixture.tex)

* The EM algorithm and associated functions are code up in [03_define_EM-fun.R](03_define_EM-fun.R).
* Simulation data is created in [01-sim-data.R](01-sim-data.R)
* The EM model is fit in [04_fit-EM_sim.R](04_fit-EM_sim.R) and diagnosed in [05_diagnose-EM.R](05_diagnose-EM.R).
